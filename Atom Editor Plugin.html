We created an official plugin for the <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom text editor</a> to make writing Lua scripts for Tabletop Simulator super easy and fun!
<br />Atom is a free, open source, and cross-platform text editor created by <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>:
<br />
<blockquote><em>Atom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the coreâ€”a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file.</em></blockquote>
<br />Our official plugin introduces syntax highlighting, code autocompletion for the Tabletop Simulator Lua API, and functions to interact with the game. The in-game editor will continue to exist for quick access to scripts, but development on it will cease to continue.
 
Prefer another text editor? Take look at our <a href="http://berserk-games.com/knowledgebase/external-editor-api/">External Editor API</a> to make your own plugin.
 
<h2>Syntax Highlighting</h2>
All standard Lua syntax is highlighted in multiple colors to help with readability.

<h2>Code Autocompletion</h2>
The entire Tabletop Simulator Lua Scripting API (with the exception of the <a href="http://berserk-games.com/knowledgebase/player/"><font face="monospace">Player</font></a> class) has been added to the native Atom autocomplete system. Easily see all of the member variables and functions available to you with their parameters, return type, short description, and a link directly to our Knowledge Base with more information for that variable or function. Functions belonging to the Lua standard library classes such as <font face="monospace">math</font>, <font face="monospace">coroutine</font>, or <font face="monospace">os</font> link directly to the official Lua documentation.

<h2>Tabletop Simulator Interactivity</h2>
The Atom plugin can directly connect to a running instance of Tabletop Simulator to get all of the existing Lua scripts on <a href="http://berserk-games.com/knowledgebase/object/"><font face="monospace">Objects</font></a> and to call Save & Play. Both functions can be called directly from the Packages menu or the right click contextual menu. TTS must be running with the game loaded for these functions to work.

<h3>Get Lua Scripts</h3>
Downloads all existing scripts in a loaded Tabletop Simulator game with Atom. You will need to call Get Lua Scripts every time you change to a different game in TTS.
 
<strong>Note:</strong> Every time you start up Atom, the cached local *.lua files are deleted.
 
<h3>Save & Play</h3>
Saves all Lua files in Atom, uploads them to a loaded Tabletop Simulator game, and reloads the current game (same as Save & Play in the in-game editor).

<h2>Print Messages</h2>
All <font face="monospace">print()</font> functions automatically send their messages to Atom's console (ctrl + alt + i).
 
<h2>Error Messages</h2>
All Lua errors are automatically sent to Atom's console (ctrl + alt + i).
